This is an extension to the Symphony XSLT Content Management System. It allows 
overriding Admin CSS styles by CSS rules placed in 'assets/aco.css'. The 
extension simply appends the 'aco.css' stylesheet to the head of admin pages.


[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the 'admin_css_override' folder in this archive to your Symphony 
   'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Admin CSS Override", choose Enable from the 
   with-selected menu, then click Apply.


[USAGE]

1. Place your CSS rules in assets/aco.css. There are sample rules included, 
   changing Symphony's navigation dropdown style.


[UPDATING]

If you ever update this extension, DO NOT OVERWRITE your aco.css file. 
(Just in case: You DO have a backup of your website, dont't you?)
