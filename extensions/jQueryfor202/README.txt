jQuery for 2.0.2
------------------------------------

Version: 1.0
Author: Nils Werner (nils.werner@gmail.com)
Build Date: 2009-05-26
Requirements: Symphony 2.0.2 or older!


[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the 'jquery_for_202' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "jQuery for 2.0.2" entry, choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now use jQuery in your Backend as if you'd have Symphony Version 2.0.3 or newer installed.

[NOTES]

- This is just a fix for people who don't want to upgrade to 2.0.3! I recommend everybody to upgrade instead of using this extension.
- "No conflict"-mode enabled: You have to use jQuery() instead of $()!
