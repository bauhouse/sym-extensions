Breadcrumb
------------------------------------

Version: 1.0
Author: Alistair Kearney (alistair@symphony21.com)
Build Date: 2nd Jan 2009
Requirements: Latest Symphony 2 build, ASDC Library v1.0

Includes a Data Source that, based on the current page, will provide a focused XML structure representing the
parent hierarchy. It is more efficient than a conventional Navigation DS, since there is less redundant data
and is much easier to traverse with xpath.


[REQUIREMENTS]

  at http://github.com/pointybeard/asdc/tree/master and grab the latest stable version using 
  "git clone git://github.com/pointybeard/asdc.git".
