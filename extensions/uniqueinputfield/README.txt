Field: Unique Text Input
------------------------------------

Version: 1.3
Author: Symphony Team (team@symphony21.com)
Build Date: 12th December 2008
Requirements: Symphony Beta revision 5 or greater.


[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the 'uniqueinputfield' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Unique Text Input", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "Unique Text Input" field to your sections.


[USAGE]

- Behaves identically to a normal text input, however it enforces uniqueness and 
  you cannot group the output in Data Sources.

- Two modes allow you to choose between throwing an error, "This must be unique", or attempting 
  to make the handle unique automatically by appending an number, E.G. "my-entry-handle-2"


[CHANGE LOG]

1.3 	- Fixed logic behind automatically creating unique handles.
