This is an extension to the Symphony XSLT Content Management System. It will 
enhance edit pages in the publish area by appending configurable 'textformatter 
labels' to existing (HTML) labels of textformatter-enabled textareas.


[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the 'textformatter_labels' folder in this archive to your Symphony 
   'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Textformatter Labels", choose Enable from the 
   with-selected menu, then click Apply.


[USAGE]

1. Once you have installed the extension, it will automatically append 
   textformatter names to (HTML) labels of textformatter-enabled textareas on 
   edit pages.

2. Optional: In Symphony "Preferences" you may configure label text to 
   override standard textformatter names. You may as well define link URLs for 
   textformatter labels to point to.
