System Date
------------------------------------

Version: 0.1 (alpha)
Author: Alistair Kearney (alistair@symphony-cms.com)
Build Date: 5th August 2009
Requirements: Symphony 2.0.6

Exposes the internal creation date of an entry (read-only) in the format of a normal date field.

NOTE: This field is not complete. The only thing it currently does is added the system date to the publish table
for the section.


[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the 'system_date_field' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: System Date", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "System Date" field to your sections.



[USAGE]

- Functions similar to the normal Date field in Symphony, however it does not allow editing 
of the value contains, instead exposing the entry Creation Date as stored internally by Symphony.
