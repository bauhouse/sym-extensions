		<h1>Getting Started with Email Template Filters</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<h3>Comparison</h3>
		<p>
			The Email Template Filter extension provides a way to create and control emails
			that are sent when new entries are created from the frontend, giving you as much
			control over the content as possible, making it easier to debug.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is an improvement over the <em>&#x201c;Send Email&#x201d;</em> filter in many
			important ways:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The form can't be hijacked to send email to <em>whoever</em> the hijacker wants</li>
			<li>You don't have to edit your XSLT to change the basics of the email, meaning
				a copy editor could tweak the templates to their liking, if you trust them</li>
			<li>
				You can pull data from anywhere in the system and email it
			</li>
			<li>You've got the ability to easily debug the contents of the email.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			That's not to say that it's some pinnacle of perfection, there probably are problems,
			and probably are things that could be done better, your feedback is welcome.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before we start, I should make it clear that I'm assuming you already have some
			knowledge of how to use Symphony, not limited to creating pages, events and
			datasources.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Client demands</h3>
		<p>
			So, what are we going to do with it? Well, I was <em>kinda</em> thinking, <em>kinda</em>,
			that we'd do something that is fairly common and create a contact form suitable for
			a large company; <em>&#x201c;Generic Placeholder Manufacturing&#x201d;</em> or GPM for short.
		</p>
		<p>
			As with any client, GPM has requirements, today they want a large pineapple and a stack
			of chocolate coated, deep fried elephants, but thankfully tomorrow we <em>think</em> we
			know that they'll want a form that:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Allows their potential clients or existing members to contact them</li>
			<li>Is sent to a different address depending on the visitors choice</li>
			<li>Is sent to a different office depending on the visitors choice.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			You're probably thinking that's quite a tall order, and not something you can easily
			create in Symphony, fortunately it is <em>quite</em> easy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Basically what we'll be doing is creating a Symphony page, attaching a couple of datasources
			to it, then emailing its output across the internet.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, what are you waiting for? <em>Get to it!</em>

		<h2>Building it</h2>
		<h3>Creating sections</h3>
		<p>
			The first thing we need to do is create a couple of new sections, one will store information
			regarding GPMs offices, the other will store data saved from the contact form.
		</p>
		<p>
			Create the <em>&#x201c;Office Locations&#x201d;</em> section with these fields:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Location</dt>
			<dd>The location of the office, any text input type field should do quite nicely.</dd>
			<dt>General Enquiry Email</dt>
			<dd>The email address to use for general enquiries.</dd>
			<dt>Member Enquiry Email</dt>
			<dd>The email address to use for general enquiries, a text input with email validation is best for both.</dd>
			<dt>Contact Submissions</dt>
			<dd>A Bi-Link field pointing at the section of the same&#160;name.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			And the <em>&#x201c;Contact Submissions&#x201d;</em> section with these fields:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>First Name</dt>
			<dd>A text input will do the trick.</dd>
			<dt>Last Name</dt>
			<dd>Another text input.</dd>
			<dt>Email</dt>
			<dd>Just like the email addresses above.</dd>
			<dt>Type</dt>
			<dd>A select box with two choices: <em>&#x201c;General&#x201d;</em> or <em>&#x201c;Member&#x201d;</em></dd>
			<dt>Message</dt>
			<dd>A textarea, with a formatter of some kind or you'll run the risk of user input breaking your email.</dd>
			<dt>Office Location</dt>
			<dd>A Bi-Link field pointing at the section of the same&#160;name.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h3>Dummy copy time</h3>
		<p>
			Now would be a good time to enter some test data into your sections, for example here's my
			<em>&#x201c;Office Locations&#x201d;</em> section:
		</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/section-office-locations-index.png" alt="">
		</div>
		<p>
			And here's my <em>&#x201c;Contact Submissions&#x201d;</em> section:
		</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/section-contact-submissions-index.png" alt="">
		</div>
		<p>
			You can enter more if you like, but we only really need a couple of each.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Creating the datasource</h3>
		<p>
			Now we need a datasource to retrieve an entry from the <em>&#x201c;Contact Submissions&#x201d;</em>
			section, lets call it: <em>&#x201c;Content Submission by Id&#x201d;</em>. It's purpose &#x2014; to fetch
			just <em>one</em> entry from the <em>&#x201c;Content Submissions&#x201d;</em> section.
		</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/create-datasource.png" alt="">
		</div>
		<p>
			A few things you should definitely note:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>We're filtering by <code>$etf-entry-id</code>, it is a special parameter that is populated by
				the event we create in a few steps, don't forget to include it</li>
			<li>The other parameter that we're filtering with, <code>$entry-id</code>, is created in the next step</li>
			<li>In the included elements, only one (<code>office-location: entries</code>) of the two
				<code>office-location</code> items is selected. Because we used the Bi-Link field to link
				our two sections together, having this item selected means we have access to the linked
				entry without needing a second datasource.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Creating the email page</h3>
		<p>
			We need to create a new Symphony page, it will have one purpose &#x2014; to provide the HTML
			that you want to send to the client:
		</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/create-email-page.png" alt="">
		</div>
		<p>
			As you can see, I've attached the datasource we created in the previous step to this page,
			and also defined that <code>$entry-id</code> parameter that is uses. The parameter assures
			that we pull the correct entry from the datasource.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the page is ready take a look at <code>{$root}/email-contact-details/{$entry-id}/?debug</code>
			and examine the XML, here's an excerpt from mine:
		</p>
		<pre>&lt;entry id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
    &lt;office-location mode=&quot;entries&quot; entries=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;section id=&quot;4&quot; handle=&quot;office-locations&quot;&gt;Office Locations&lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;entry id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
            &lt;location handle=&quot;brisbane&quot;&gt;Brisbane&lt;/location&gt;
            &lt;general-enquiry-email&gt;general@brisbane...&lt;/general-enquiry-email&gt;
            &lt;member-enquiry-email&gt;member@brisbane...&lt;/member-enquiry-email&gt;
        &lt;/entry&gt;
    &lt;/office-location&gt;
    &lt;first-name handle=&quot;john&quot;&gt;John&lt;/first-name&gt;
    &lt;last-name handle=&quot;doe&quot;&gt;Doe&lt;/last-name&gt;
    &lt;email handle=&quot;john-examplecom&quot;&gt;john@example.com&lt;/email&gt;
    &lt;type&gt;
        &lt;item handle="general">General&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/type&gt;
    &lt;message word-count=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;</pre>
		<p>
			You should take some time to make the page output the HTML you want to be sent, how you do
			this really is up to you, treat it as a normal Symphony page, because that's what it&#160;is,
			the Email Template Filter extension doesn't care as long as it exists.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Creating the template</h3>
		<p>
			Now comes the <em>groovy</em> part, we need to create a new template. Take yourself to the
			<em>&#x201c;Emails &#x2013; Templates&#x201d;</em> page and click the <em>Create New</em> button.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fill in the top section of the page, again selecting the datasource we created, like so:
		</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/create-template-one.png" alt="">
		</div>
		<p>
			Next up, conditions. Each condition hangs on its expression, an XPath that tests against the
			XML output from the selected datasources. The first condition with an expression that doesn't
			evaluate to <code>false</code>, or with an expression that is left empty, will be used, any
			conditions afterwards will be ignored.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each condition also has a range of fields for the subject, sender name, address to send from,
			and addresses to send to (comma delimited). Each of these fields can accept XPath expressions
			wrapped in curly braces, for example: <code>{datasource/entry/@id}</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, time to actually our first condition, like so:
		</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/create-template-two.png" alt="">
		</div>
		<p>
			Above we're using the expression field to limit the condition to entries intended for the
			<em>&#x201c;General Enquiry&#x201d;</em> address. To target the <em>&#x201c;Member Enquiry&#x201d;</em>
			address, simply create a new condition, but change the expression to match <code>member</code>
			instead of <code>general</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			We've also selected the page we created above and in the URL parameters we've placed an
			expression to get the id of the entry. This will be read by the page and set as the value
			of the <code>$entry-id</code> parameter, which in turn is used by the datasource.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Create the event</h3>
		<p>
			Now, what we need is an event, because what the Email Template Filter extension does is
			make the template we created above into an event filter.
		</p>
		<p>
			So create an event for the <em>&#x201c;Content Submissions&#x201d;</em> section, selecting
			the appropriate filter:
		</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/create-event.png" alt="">
		</div>
		<p>
			Obviously this event needs to be attached to a page somewhere that has a form, so go ahead,
			copy the example form provided by the event into a new page. After doing that, you should
			be ready to send your first enquiry email.
		</p>
	</div>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			Hopefully it's now clear how the extension works and how to make the most of it. I'm sure
			you've got questions, since there are things that I've deliberately left out, due to a lack
			of time, but I hope I've written enough to make you sense of things.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's all for now, if you have any comments, leave them on the forum.
