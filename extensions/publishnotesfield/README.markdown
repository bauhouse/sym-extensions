## Notes

* The "Label" field is required by Symphony, the extension outputs your "Label" in handle-ised form as the ID if your notes field on the Publish screen. While not immediately useful it gives you a hook for use by custom JavaScript if you need it.

* With great power comes great responsibility: the "Note" field let you put whatever you want in it and that raw output is included on the Publish screen.
